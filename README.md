# wtp (Worktree Plus)

A powerful Git worktree management tool that extends git's worktree
functionality with automated setup, branch tracking, and project-specific hooks.

## Features - Why wtp Instead of git-worktree?

### üöÄ No More Path Gymnastics

**git-worktree pain:**
`git worktree add ../project-worktrees/feature/auth feature/auth` **wtp
solution:** `wtp add feature/auth`

wtp automatically generates sensible paths based on branch names. Your
`feature/auth` branch goes to `../worktrees/feature/auth` - no redundant typing,
no path errors.

### üßπ Clean Branch Management

**git-worktree pain:** Remove worktree, then manually delete the branch. Forget
the second step? Orphaned branches accumulate. **wtp solution:**
`wtp remove --with-branch feature/done` - One command removes both

Keep your repository clean. When a feature is truly done, remove both the
worktree and its branch in one atomic operation. No more forgotten branches
cluttering your repo.

### üõ†Ô∏è Zero-Setup Development Environments

**git-worktree pain:** Create worktree ‚Üí Copy .env ‚Üí Install deps ‚Üí Run
migrations ‚Üí Finally start coding **wtp solution:** Configure once in
`.wtp.yml`, then every `wtp add` runs your setup automatically

```yaml
hooks:
  post_create:
    # Copy real files from the MAIN worktree into the NEW worktree
    - type: copy
      from: ".env" # Allowed even if gitignored. 'from' is always relative to the MAIN worktree
      to: ".env" # Destination is relative to the NEW worktree

    # Prefer explicit, single-step setup commands
    - type: command
      command: "npm ci" # Example for Node.js (replace with your build/deps tool)
    - type: command
      command: "npm run db:setup"
    # Alternative: using make or a task runner
    # - type: command
    #   command: "make bootstrap"
```

Perfect for microservices, monorepos, or any project with complex setup
requirements.

### üìç Instant Worktree Navigation

**git-worktree pain:** `cd ../../../worktrees/feature/auth` (if you remember the
path) **wtp solution:** `wtp cd feature/auth` with tab completion

Jump between worktrees instantly. Use `wtp cd @` to return to your main
worktree. No more terminal tab confusion.

```

## Quick Start

### Automatic Path Generation (Recommended)

```bash
# Create worktree from existing branch (local or remote)
# ‚Üí Creates worktree at ../worktrees/feature/auth
# Automatically tracks remote branch if not found locally
wtp add feature/auth

# Create worktree with new branch
# ‚Üí Creates worktree at ../worktrees/feature/new-feature
wtp add -b feature/new-feature

# Create new branch from specific commit
# ‚Üí Creates worktree at ../worktrees/hotfix/urgent
wtp add -b hotfix/urgent abc1234

# Create new branch tracking a different remote branch
# ‚Üí Creates worktree at ../worktrees/feature/test with branch tracking origin/main
wtp add -b feature/test origin/main

# Remote branch handling examples:

# Automatically tracks remote branch if not found locally
# ‚Üí Creates worktree tracking origin/feature/remote-only
wtp add feature/remote-only

# If branch exists in multiple remotes, shows helpful error:
# Error: branch 'feature/shared' exists in multiple remotes: origin, upstream
# Please specify the remote explicitly (e.g., --track origin/feature/shared)
wtp add feature/shared

# Explicitly specify which remote to track
wtp add -b feature/shared upstream/feature/shared
```

### Management Commands

```bash
# List all worktrees
wtp list

# Example output:
# PATH                      BRANCH           HEAD
# ----                      ------           ----
# @ (main worktree)*        main             c72c7800
# feature/auth              feature/auth     def45678
# ../project-hotfix         hotfix/urgent    abc12345

# Remove worktree only (by worktree name)
wtp remove feature/auth
wtp remove --force feature/auth  # Force removal even if dirty

# Remove worktree and its branch
wtp remove --with-branch feature/auth              # Only if branch is merged
wtp remove --with-branch --force-branch feature/auth  # Force branch deletion
```

## Configuration

wtp uses `.wtp.yml` for project-specific configuration:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
defaults:
  # Base directory for worktrees (relative to project root)
  base_dir: "../worktrees"

hooks:
  post_create:
    # Copy gitignored files from main worktree to new worktree
    # Note: 'from' is relative to main worktree, 'to' is relative to new worktree
    - type: copy
      from: ".env" # Copy actual .env file (gitignored)
      to: ".env"

    - type: copy
      from: ".claude" # Copy AI context file (gitignored)
      to: ".claude"

    # Execute commands in the new worktree
    - type: command
      command: "npm install"
      env:
        NODE_ENV: "development"

    - type: command
      command: "make db:setup"
      work_dir: "."
```

### Copy Hooks: Main Worktree Reference

Copy hooks are designed to help you bootstrap new worktrees using files from
your main worktree (even if they are gitignored):

- `from`: path is always resolved relative to the main worktree.
- `to`: path is resolved relative to the newly created worktree.
- Supports files and directories, including entries ignored by Git (e.g.,
  `.env`, `.claude`, `.cursor/`).

Examples:

```yaml
hooks:
  post_create:
    # Copy local env and AI context from MAIN worktree into the new worktree
    - type: copy
      from: ".env"
      to: ".env"

    - type: copy
      from: ".claude"
      to: ".claude"

    # Directory copy also works
    - type: copy
      from: ".cursor/"
      to: ".cursor/"
```

This behavior applies regardless of where you run `wtp add` from (main worktree
or any other worktree).

## Shell Integration

### Tab Completion Setup

#### If installed via Homebrew

Tab completion is automatically installed! No manual setup required.

#### If installed via go install

„ÉØ„É≥„É©„Ç§„Éä„Éº„ÅßË£úÂÆå„Å® cd „Éï„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çí„Åæ„Å®„ÇÅ„Å¶ÊúâÂäπÂåñ„Åß„Åç„Åæ„Åô:

```bash
# Bash: Add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(wtp shell-init bash)"

# Zsh: Add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(wtp shell-init zsh)"

# Fish: Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
wtp shell-init fish | source
```

Ë£úÂÆå„Å†„Åë„ÇíÊúâÂäπÂåñ„Åó„Åü„ÅÑÂ†¥Âêà„ÅØ `wtp completion <shell>` „ÇíÂçòÁã¨„Åß eval / source „Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ

### Navigation with wtp cd

The `wtp cd` command outputs the absolute path to a worktree. You can use it in two ways:

#### Direct Usage
```bash
# Change to a worktree using command substitution
cd "$(wtp cd feature/auth)"

# Change to the main worktree
cd "$(wtp cd @)"
```

#### With Shell Hook (Recommended)

For a more seamless experience, enable the shell hook („Åæ„Åü„ÅØ‰∏äË®ò„ÅÆ `shell-init` „ÇíÂà©Áî®):

```bash
# Bash: Add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(wtp hook bash)"

# Zsh: Add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(wtp hook zsh)"

# Fish: Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
wtp hook fish | source
```

Then use the simplified syntax:

```bash
# Change to a worktree by its name
wtp cd feature/auth

# Change to the root worktree using the '@' shorthand
wtp cd @

# Tab completion works!
wtp cd <TAB>
```

#### Complete Setup (Lazy Loading for Homebrew Users)

For Homebrew users who want both completion and cd functionality with zero configuration, just press `wtp <TAB>` once - it triggers the lazy loader that internally runs `wtp shell-init <shell>`.

## Worktree Structure

With the default configuration (`base_dir: "../worktrees"`):

```
<project-root>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .wtp.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/

../worktrees/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/          # wtp add feature/auth
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ payment/       # wtp add feature/payment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bug-123/       # wtp add hotfix/bug-123
```

Branch names with slashes are preserved as directory structure, automatically
organizing worktrees by type/category.

## Error Handling

wtp provides clear error messages:

```bash
# Branch not found
Error: branch 'nonexistent' not found in local or remote branches

# Multiple remotes have same branch
Error: branch 'feature' exists in multiple remotes: origin, upstream. Please specify remote explicitly

# Worktree already exists
Error: failed to create worktree: exit status 128

# Uncommitted changes
Error: Cannot remove worktree with uncommitted changes. Use --force to override
```
