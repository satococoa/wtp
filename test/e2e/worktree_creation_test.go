// Living Specifications for Worktree Creation Workflows
// These tests serve as executable documentation of user behavior

// TestUserCreatesWorktree_WithExistingLocalBranch_ShouldCreateWorktreeAtDefaultPath tests
// the most common user workflow: creating a worktree for an existing local branch.
//
// User Story: As a developer working on a feature branch, I want to create a worktree
// for an existing branch so I can quickly switch to working on that feature in isolation.
//
// Business Value: This eliminates the need to stash changes or commit incomplete work
// when switching between features, improving developer productivity.

	// And: Worktree directory should exist
	framework.AssertWorktreeExists(t, repo, "feature/auth")
}

// TestUserCreatesWorktree_WithNewBranchFlag_ShouldCreateBranchAndWorktree tests
// creating a new branch and worktree simultaneously.
//
// User Story: As a developer starting a new feature, I want to create both a new branch
// and its worktree in one command so I can immediately start working on the feature.
//
// Business Value: Streamlines the workflow of starting new features by combining
// branch creation and worktree setup into a single operation.

// TestUserCreatesWorktree_WithCustomPath_ShouldCreateAtSpecifiedLocation tests
// the flexibility to specify custom worktree locations.
//
// User Story: As a developer with specific project organization needs, I want to
// specify exactly where my worktree should be created so it fits my workflow.
//
// Business Value: Provides flexibility for different team workflows and project
// structures, accommodating various developer preferences and constraints.

// TestUserCreatesWorktree_WithoutBranchName_ShouldShowBranchRequiredError tests
// input validation from the user's perspective.
//
// User Story: As a developer, when I forget to specify a branch name, I want to
// receive a clear error message so I understand what's required.
//
// Business Value: Clear error messages reduce frustration and improve the user
// experience by guiding users toward correct usage.

// TestUserCreatesWorktree_WhenPathAlreadyExists_ShouldRequireForceFlag tests
// conflict resolution from the user's perspective.
//
// User Story: As a developer, when I try to create a worktree where a directory
// already exists, I want to be warned and given the option to force overwrite.
//
// Business Value: Prevents accidental data loss while providing flexibility for
// experienced users who want to overwrite existing directories.

// creating a new branch from a specific commit or branch.
//
// User Story: As a developer, when I use "wtp add -b new-branch main",
// I want the new branch to be created from the main branch, not from the current branch.
//
// Business Value: Allows developers to create feature branches from specific
// base branches without having to checkout the base branch first.
